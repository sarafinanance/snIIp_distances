FOR TOMORROW:

STEP 3. 
This spectrum was then de-redshifted and the restframe V-I color of the SN was calculated 
De-redshift the spetrum and calculate restframe V-I color

- The V and I apparent magnitudes 
- M_I (absolute) 
- mu = I - M_I 
--> - From M_I, subtract off I from sncosmo

-> SETUP MCMC FOR UNCERTAINTIES (SEE BELOW)
-> CALCULATE M_I_ABSOLUTE FROM V_FE_50 & V and I colors above
M_I = -4.6 log10(vFe/5000)+0.7 ((V-I)-0.53) - 17.43
SEE BELOW FUNCTION, JUST NEED TO PLUG IN V_ AND I_
-> CALCULATE MU = I - M_I

QUESTIONS FOR PETER:
- HOW TO FOLD IN MULTIPLE EXPLOSION DATES FOR V50 CALCULATION (EASY CODE QUESTION)?

NEXT: need to double check whether this should be days_post_explosion or explosion_date, because this is throwing it off. 
Think it needs to be days_post_explosion

Need to check what to do about uncertainties
-> Fit to g', r', i' each have an uncertainty 
---> Do another MCMC where the uncertainties are g'r'i', and then you feed those in, dispersed by their uncertainties, to sncosmo to get new 
---> V, I
---> Run 1000 MCMCs to see what the uncertainties are on each band which will impact V and I uncertainties 

-> Fit to velocity has an uncertainty (from the covar) - might be small compared to just the method itself 
-> Question is how to fold all of these uncertainties in! 
---> Easiest way: carry them along, take derivative of M_I
---> d(M_I)/d(v) where v is the velocity. 
---> d(M_I)/d(V) where V is mag, and also for I
---> and just from that equation, can give final uncertainty on velocity and all mags is this value
